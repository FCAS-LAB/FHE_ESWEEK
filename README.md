# Homomorphic Encryption Task Graph Mapping Framework

This repository provides a Python-based framework for Design Space Exploration (DSE) of homomorphic encryption applications in multi-chiplet systems. It includes bilevel optimization algorithms, mapping and topology generation ablation experiments, and related experiment scripts.

## Features

- **Bilevel Optimization Algorithm**: Optimize mapping and topology jointly.
- **Baseline Ablations**: Isolated experiments on mapping and topology for comparison.
- **Flexible Input**: Support for custom benchmark files, trace files, and topologies.
- **Modular Structure**: Easy to extend for new strategies or applications.

# How to use
```
git clone https://github.com/FCAS-LAB/FHE_ESWEEK.git
cd Bilevel
bash scripts/run.sh
# python main.py --time_file=... --bench_file=... --trace_file=... --topo_file=... --show_file=...
